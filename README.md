This project encompasses four major features: Anonymous Chat with Doctor, Generative AI Chatbot, Reports Scanner, and User Dashboard. Together, these features aim to provide users with a holistic and personalized health management experience.

### 1. Anonymous Chat with Doctor
The Anonymous Chat with Doctor feature ensures that users can access professional medical advice without the need to disclose their identity. This feature is particularly beneficial for individuals who may feel uncomfortable discussing personal health issues or those who prefer to keep their medical consultations private.

#### How It Works:
Users can initiate a chat session by selecting the anonymous chat option on the platform. They are then connected to a licensed medical professional who can provide advice, answer questions, and suggest next steps. The chat interface is designed to be intuitive, with options to attach photos or medical documents if needed.
